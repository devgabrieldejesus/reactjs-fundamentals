## 🚀 About the challenge

In this challenge, I had to continue developing the transaction management application, GoFinances.
The objective was to practice what I had learned so far in React.js together with TypeScript, using routes and sending files by form.

This was an application that had to connect to my [Challenge 06](https://github.com/gabrieldejesus/database-upload) backend, and display the created transactions and allow the import of a CSV file to generate new records in the database.
